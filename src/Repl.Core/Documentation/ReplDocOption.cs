	/// <remarks>
	/// Mirrors <see cref="ReplDocCommand.IsHidden"/>: an aggregate model omits hidden options
	/// entirely, while a model built for an explicitly targeted command includes them with this
	/// flag set, so an app author can still inventory them. Hidden options remain parsable from the
	/// command line and the REPL; consumers that generate agent-facing schemas must omit them.
	/// </remarks>

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets a value indicating whether the option is suppressed on programmatic surfaces only.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Unlike <see cref="IsHidden"/>, an automation-hidden option is always present in this model —
	/// human-facing exports keep it, which is why the flag exists rather than an omission.
	/// Consumers that generate agent-facing schemas must omit it. Not an access-control boundary.
